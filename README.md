Do you want to make beautiful, informative visualizations with ease? If so, then you must learn seaborn! Seaborn is a visualization library that is an essential part of the python data science toolkit. In this course, you will learn how to use seaborn's sophisticated visualization tools to analyze multiple real world datasets including the American Housing Survey, college tuition data, and guests from the popular television series, The Daily Show. Following this course, you will be able to use seaborn functions to visualize your data in several different formats and customize seaborn plots for your unique needs.
